# Achievement 4 Python Fundamentals for Data Analysts

# In this Project for the Data Analyst Immersion Course from Careerfoundry, we started to use python fundamentals for Data Analysts.

# We have been tasked to identifie and Analyse a Grocery Basket Sales for an existing Company named Instacart who wishes to improve their Sales for certain Products and areas.


# Key Questions

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day
are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times
when there are fewer orders.
● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend
the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use
simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product
orders.
● The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:
● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age?
Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
● What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles?

Note: Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project brief
have been fabricated for the purpose of this Achievement.

# We have therefore cleaned and  wrangled Data based on all Exercises from the Previous Achievements which resultet in the Final Excel Report for Instacarts Stakeholders
